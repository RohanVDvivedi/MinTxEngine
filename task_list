PICKED

  * allowing latches to be preserved between mini transactions
    * on completion return the page latches held counter using a pointer
    * on starting a new mini transaction take this value from user to initialize in the new mini transaction
    * allow releasing latches without a pointer to the mini transaction
    * add appropriate comments to explain how to use this new feature and update test cases

  * PAGE_ALLOCATION OPTIMIZATION
  * implement a cache for free space mapper page ids with most free pages in increasing order of their page ids, and use them for faster allocation
    * like a separate faster allocation case which checks these free space mapper pages first, then fall backs to current code
    * also update this cache when a new page is allocated or freed
    * this cache should be randomized to randomly select pages for allocation
    * do this caching while releasing latch on the free space mapper page
    * simple API like
      * void update_free_space_mapper_page_in_availability_cache_UNSAFE(mini_transaction_engine* mte, const void* free_space_mapper_page, uint64_t free_space_mapper_page_id); // to be called when ever you release a latch on the free space mapper page
      * uint64_t get_any_free_space_mapper_page_from_availability_cache_UNSAFE(mini_transaction_engine* mte); // return of 0, implies nothing available
        * this will not give you enough information as you also need to check that the corresponding page we decide to allocate also needs to be not write locked
