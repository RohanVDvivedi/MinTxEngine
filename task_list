PICKED
  * PAGE_ALLOCATION OPTIMIZATION
    * discard debug print statements

    * locking rules only need rwlock for caches, bufferpool locking conventions needs to be finalized when to descend and when to ascend the tree
    * need ascend descend type locks glock type

    * architect the solution now
    * when to update caches? (always)
    * when to reconcile with the disk? (eventually)
    * when to return from free_cache and when from the on-disk hints? (circularly and always possible from cache)
