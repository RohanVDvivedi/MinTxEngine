PICKED
  * PAGE_ALLOCATION OPTIMIZATION

    * add rwlock for the free_extents_set and full_extents_set, bufferpool locks are enough for the hints file
    * writes go to this sets first and only when they have collective WRITE_BATCH_LIMIT reached, are they flushed to disk and are emptied, with a write cache lock
    * reads access hints file directly, and newly made full pages are removed from it
      * these reads will also have atleast READ_CACHE_LIMIT extent pages cached and will remove from this result set when full extent ids show up

    * discard debug print statements
