PICKED
  * PAGE_ALLOCATION OPTIMIZATION (almost done)
    * discard debug print statements
    * review new get_extent_id and extent's (using pointer to free_space_mapper_page based) is_full functions
    * find a large enough dataset such that page_allocation is bottleneck and test with and without page_allocation_hints module, so see this module optimizing the logic in real time on a large enough dataset
    * integrate, commit and push
