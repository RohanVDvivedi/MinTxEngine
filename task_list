PICKED
  * PAGE_ALLOCATION OPTIMIZATION
    * initialize bufferpool object and the parameters it takes buffers count = 25 - 100 -> depending the size of ram
    * periodic flush job every minute

    * implement bufferpool callbacks for read, write and flush
    * implement bufferpool callbacks for can (returns true) and was flush to disk are no-op

    * build nodes containing uint64_t extent_id and bstnode for caching on both the bsts
    * add insert and remove functions, such that they are idempotent

    * locking rules only need rwlock for caches, bufferpool locking conventions needs to be finalized when to descend and when to ascend the tree
    * need ascend descend type locks glock type

    * architect the solution now
    * when to update caches? (always)
    * when to reconcile with the disk? (eventually)
    * when to return from free_cache and when from the on-disk hints? (circularly and always possible from cache)
